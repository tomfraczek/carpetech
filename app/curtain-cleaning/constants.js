      'Before the on-site cleaning process begins, we perform pre-tests to guarantee the safest, highest quality outcome for your specific types of stone, tile, or grout surfaces. This is especially important when working with acid-sensitive surfaces such as marble, terrazzo, travertine, and limestone.',
      'Our certified technicians also provide additional inspection and tape off the area to protect adjacent surfaces.',
      'They then perform dry soil removal, which clears away surface dust and dirt for better access to build-up and more effective deep-cleaning results.',
      'We carry out quality checks along the way. If the results are uneven or do not meet expectations, we re-clean the uneven area, repeating this until we achieve optimal results.',
      'Immediately following your cleaning, you will have the option to have sealants applied, that create a barrier to keep grime out and allow for easy maintenance.',
      'Our stone, tile and grout cleaning services leave your surfaces clean, protected and ready to use after only a few hours.',
